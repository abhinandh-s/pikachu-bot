## How to Use Pikachu

### 1. Direct Messaging

  : /mqp - access Model Question Papers
  : /ptp - access Practice Test Papers



### 2. Inline Query

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <video width="100%" controls>

Users can interact with the Pikachu bot via inline queries straight from the message field in any chat. All we need to do is start a message with the bot's username [@cma_buddy_bot](https://t.me/cma_buddy_bot) and enter a keyword.

Having received the query, bot will return search results. As soon as the user selects one, it is sent to the relevant chat. This way, people can request and send content from the bot in any of their chats, groups or channels.

#### Query Formats:

##### Previous Year Question Papers

PYQ: `p[PaperNumber]-[Term]-pyq`

Example
